# sqlite-go
Implementing sqlite in go as a way to learn the language.

Inspired by [Let's Build a Simple Database](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/).

I'm also using the book [SQLite Database System Design and Implementation](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Sibsankar_Haldar_SQLite_Database_System_Design_and?id=yWzwCwAAQBAJ&hl=en_US) as a reference.
